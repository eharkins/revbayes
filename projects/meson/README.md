# Building with meson

[Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/) ([git](https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson)) is a new build system that aims to replace autotools and fills the same role as CMake.

Meson makes it easy to cross-compile to Windows, Macintosh, and ARM systems from Linux (see [Cross-Compile.md](Cross-Compile.md)).

## Install tools

Before compiling revbayes, you need to install a C++ compiler.  Then you need to install meson and BOOST.

### Mac:
- First install XCode and homebrew
``` sh
brew install meson boost
```

### Debian/Ubuntu Linux
``` sh
apt-get install g++ meson libboost-dev
```

### Redhat Linux
``` sh
dnf install gcc-c++ meson boost-devel
```

### Other

You can [download ninja](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases) and install meson using python:
``` sh
python3 -m venv meson
source meson/bin/activate
pip3 install meson
```

## Build RevBayes

1. Download RevBayes from our github repository. Clone the repository using git by running the following command in the terminal:

    ``` sh
    git clone https://github.com/revbayes/revbayes.git revbayes
    ```

1. Configure and compile Revbayes:
   
    ``` sh
    ( cd revbayes/ ; git checkout development )  # Probably you want the development branch
    ( cd revbayes/projects/meson/ ; ./generate.sh )
    meson build revbayes --prefix=$HOME/Applications/revbayes
    ninja -C build install
    ```

    This creates a `build` directory where the build will take place, and says that the executables will eventually be installed in `$HOME/Applications/revbayes`.

1. For the MPI version, add `-Dmpi=true` to the `meson` command.

    ``` sh
    meson build revbayes -Dmpi=true --prefix=$HOME/Applications/revbayes
    ```

## Configuration

Settings such as `mpi` or `prefix` can be changed using `meson configure`:
``` sh
cd build
meson configure -Dmpi=false
meson configure -Dprefix=/usr/local
```
You can also examine current options by leaving off the argument:
``` sh
cd build
meson configure
```

### Option: MPI

To build with MPI, set the `mpi` option:
```
meson build-mpi -Dmpi=true -Dprefix=$HOME/Applications/revbayes-mpi
ninja -C build-mpi install
```

### Option: Jupyter Kernel

To build the jupyter kernel, set the `jupyter` option:
```
meson build-jupyter -Djupyter=true -Dprefix=$HOME/Applications/revbayes-jupyter
ninja -C build-jupyter install
```

### Option: RevStudio

To build the `RevStudio` GUI in addition to `rb`, you need to
* install the GTK2 library
* add the `-Dstudio=true` flag when running meson:

To install GTK2 on Debian & Ubuntu:
```
apt-get install libgtk+-2.0-dev
```

To install GTK2 on Mac:
```
brew install gtk2
```

After GTK2 is installed, you can then configure and build RevStudio as follows:
```
meson build-gtk -Dstudio=true -Dprefix=$HOME/Applications/revbayes-gui
ninja -C build-gtk install
```

## Troubleshooting:

* `rb: command not found`

    The problem is that you tried to run RevBayes but your computer doesn't know where the executable is. The easiest way is to add the directory in which you _installed_ RevBayes to your system path:

    ```
    export PATH=<prefix>/bin:$PATH  
    ```

    For example, if you set `-Dprefix=$HOME/Applications/revbayes`, you would do

    ```
    export PATH=$HOME/Applications/revbayes/bin:$PATH
    ```

* meson fails to configure

    You can look in `build/meson-logs/meson-log.txt` error log messages to help diagnose the problem.

* meson cannot find GTK2

    If GTK2 is not installed or not usable, this will produce an error message.

    Meson uses `pkg-config` to find most dependencies, and to find out what compiler and linker flags they need.

    If meson cannot find GTK2, you can:
    * run `pkg-config gtk+-2.0 --cflags` to see if pkg-config can find GTK2.
    * look in `build-gtk/meson-logs/meson-log.txt` for log messages to help diagnose the problem.
